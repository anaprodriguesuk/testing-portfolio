## ðŸ“ˆ My Testing Process

1. **Test Planning**: Understand the scope, requirements, and expectations of the application. Identify key areas to test.
2. **Test Case Design**: Write test cases to ensure the app works as expected.
3. **Bug Identification**: Report and log bugs with clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity.
4. **Exploratory Testing**: Explore the application without predefined steps to identify potential issues and evaluate its usability and user experience.
5. **Test Reporting & Communication**: Record results and give feedback to help improve the product.
